    Born and raised as a Southern California girl, Lauren started dancing at the age of 3 and trained professionally in all dance styles including ballet, pointe, tap, jazz, lyrical, contemporary, hip-hop, jazz funk and heels. She competed at an eminent level until she was 18 and after high school she made her way to the LA dance industry.

She aspires to build a dance community on YouTube and create a channel that welcomes, not just other dancers who also dream of becoming a professional, but also those who share the same passion for dance as her. She is currently showcasing her choreography on her channel along with all of the tutorials to each of her routines.
